The attackers were able to gain access to one of Home Depot’s vendor environments by using a third-party vendor’s logon credentials. Then they 
exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Windows, which allowed them to pivot from the 
vendor-specific environment to the Home Depot corporate environment.
Once they were in the Home Depot network, they were able install memory scraping 
malware on over 7,500 self -checkout POS terminals (Smith, 2014). This malware was 
able to grab 56 million credit and debit cards. The malware was also able to capture 
53  million email addresses (Winter, 2014). The stolen payment cards were used to put up for 
sale and bought by carders. The stolen email addresses were helpful in putting together 
large phishing campaigns.
